## Overview
The goal of this assignment is:
  1. To provide you with a little bit of exposure to a markdown language, and
  1. To ensure you understand the mechanics of submitting document assignments.

### Directions:

Provide a response to all items that have been marked as needing a response. 
  1. For single-line responses, an HTML comment tag `(<!-- response -->)` has been added.
     * Your response should be placed to the left of this HTML comment tag.
  1. For multi-line responses, ensure your answer is placed in between the block markers.

In each of your responses note that spacing is very important to ensure your document is rendered correctly on the web. You should review the final formatted document via, e.g., One Markdown, prior to final submission.

In this assignment, fake answers have been provided. You must replace the provided answers with your own answers.

For more information about the markdown (MD) format see:

#### Section One
1. Enumerate your top four favorite subjects in college:
   1. Programming                                                             <!-- response -->
   1. History                                                                 <!-- response -->
   1. Science                                                                 <!-- response -->
   1. Social Studies                                                          <!-- response  -->
 

1. What is your major?

   > Computer Science                                                           <!-- response -->
   <!-- 
        Place your response after the first '> '.  
        A '> ' introduces a block quote.  
        Also note that the '> ' is positioned directly under the first character
        after the '1. ' above.  This is important!
   -->


1. Provide a list of possible positions you would like to obtain after graduation.

   * Software Engineer                                                            <!-- response -->
   * Network Engineer                                                                   <!-- response -->
   * Cyber Security                                                             <!-- response -->
   * Data Analyst                                                               <!-- response -->
   * Not Mcdonalds employee                                                              <!-- response -->
  <!-- 
       This is an example of an unordered list.  
       An unordered list can begin with either '* ' or '- '.  
       Feel free to add and delete response lines as needed.
  -->

#### Section Two
1. What is your primary reason for taking COMP122?

   > I would like to learn assembly language                           <!-- response -->

1. What is the most important thing you want to get out of COMP122?

   > To learn everything I can about this class                                        <!-- response -->

1. What is your criteria for success for COMP122?

   > I will consider this class to be a success if and only if I              <!-- response -->
     am able to improve my programming skills. I want to be an                <!-- response -->
     Software Engineer and there is more things to learn if I don't               <!-- response -->
     want to be a one trick pony so I can get more of a stable job.           <!-- response -->
                                                                              <!-- response -->
   <!-- The above is an example of a multi-line response. -->
   <!-- Note that a respons tag must be assiciated with each line. -->
   <!-- Feel free to add or remove additional response lines as needed. -->


1. What one thing can I do to help ensure you are successful in this class?
   
   * Drilling commands                                                <!-- response -->

1. What one thing can you do to help ensure you are successful in this class?
   
   * Practice!                                            <!-- response -->

#### Section Three
1. Modify the following Java method, `add4`, to include a fourth formal parameter that is added to the sum.

   ```java response
   static int add4(int a, int b, int c, int d) {                                     
     int sum=0;

     sum = a + b + c + d;

     return sum;
   }
   ```
   <!-- 
        The three ticks ('`') opens up a code block. You can also include
        the tag (e.g., java) that identifies how to render the code.
        All the code must be between the two sets of 3-ticks, and the code
        must indented to the column in which the three ticks begin.
        The "response" tag must be present to be include in your response key.
   -->


1. Perform the following mathematical addition.  Replace each 'x' with the appropriate digit.  Also write your final anwser in the approrpate location:

   ```response
         0000 
         0013 
       + 0005 
       ------
         0018 

   Final Answer:  
   ```

   <!-- 
        This is a seconde example of a multi-line response block.
   -->


1. Update the following table by replacing 'x' with the correct value.

   <!-- response start -->

   | A  | B  | C  | A+B+C |
   |----|----|----|-------|
   | 1  | 2  | 0  |   3   |
   | 3  | 4  | 1  |   8   |
   | 2  | 2  | 2  |   6   |
   | 8  | 1  | 1  |  10   |

   <!-- response end -->

   <!-- 
        This is an example of a multi-line response block.
        Everything between the "response start" and "response end" is included
        in the answer key.
   -->
